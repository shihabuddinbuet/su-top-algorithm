# su-top-algorithm
An Implementation of different algorithms in multiple ways using java. 

## Description
The algorithms have been implemented only for competence development, not for production usages.
But it might help to improve skills. It contains implemention 
of different algorithms like searching, sorting etc in different ways.

## Getting started
As all the codes are written in Java, Java sdk must be installed befor running any main 
application. Lets see how to run `BinarySearch` after cloning the project. 
1. Open any terminal
2. Clone the project : `git clone git@github.com:shihabuddinbuet/su-top-algorithm.git`
3. Run `cd su-top-algorithm/src/com/su/algo/search`
4. Run `javac BinarySearch.java` to compile
5. Run `java BinarySearch`
6. Give the requested input and the application will show output.
